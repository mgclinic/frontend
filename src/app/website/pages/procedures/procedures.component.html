                                Chemical peels are a non-surgical treatment used to improve the skinâ€™s appearance by
                                exfoliating the outer layers. Dr. Chandrakar uses customized chemical solutions to treat
                                a range of skin concerns, including acne, pigmentation, fine lines, and sun damage.

                                How It Works: A solution is applied to the skin that removes dead skin cells, promoting
                                the regeneration of healthier, smoother skin.

                                Benefits: Reduces fine lines, smooths skin texture, and improves skin tone and clarity.

                                PRP therapy uses your own blood to enhance skin rejuvenation, reduce hair loss, and
                                improve the overall appearance of your skin. Dr. Chandrakar carefully injects
                                platelet-rich plasma into targeted areas to stimulate collagen production and accelerate
                                healing.

                                How It Works: Blood is drawn from the patient, processed to concentrate platelets, and
                                then re-injected into the skin to promote healing and rejuvenation.

                                Benefits: Improves skin texture, reduces wrinkles, and stimulates hair growth for those
                                with hair loss.

                                How It Works: Depending on the type and location of the scar, Dr. Chandrakar may use
                                laser therapy, microdermabrasion, or even surgical excision to reduce scar tissue.

                                Benefits: Softens the appearance of scars, improves skin texture, and promotes healing.

                                Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive procedure that exfoliates the outer layer of dead
                                skin cells to reveal smoother, healthier skin. It is an effective treatment for acne
                                scars, age spots, and fine lines.

                                How It Works: Tiny crystals are sprayed on the skin to gently exfoliate, followed by
                                suction to remove the exfoliated cells.

                                Benefits: Smoother skin, improved texture, and enhanced skin tone with minimal downtime.

                                How It Works: Laser or minor surgical procedures are used to precisely remove the
                                xanthelasma, restoring a clearer, smoother eyelid area.

                                Benefits: Removes unsightly yellowish spots, providing a more aesthetically pleasing

                            <p class="text-muted">Thread lifts are a non-surgical procedure designed to lift and tighten
                                sagging skin on the face and neck. Using special threads, Dr. Chandrakar can lift and
                                support the skin for a more youthful contour.

                                How It Works: Fine threads are inserted under the skin, which are then pulled to lift
                                and tighten the skin. The threads also stimulate collagen production, providing a
                                natural, long-lasting result.

                                Benefits: Non-surgical, minimal downtime, and effective for lifting sagging skin without
                                the need for facelifts.</p>

                                HIFU is a cutting-edge, non-invasive treatment that uses focused ultrasound energy to stimulate deep layers of the skin, promoting collagen production and tightening loose or sagging skin.

                                How It Works: High-frequency sound waves are directed at specific layers of the skin to stimulate collagen production and tighten the skin.
